# Numerical Methods Analysis and Visualization

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and implementation of selected numerical methods using Python. It explores interpolation, approximation, integration, differentiation, and statistical analysis applied to a real-valued function of two variables, F(x, y). The code performs method comparison and visual validation of results, demonstrating practical applications of theoretical algorithms.

>This project was developed as part of a university course on **Numerical Algorithms**. It serves both as a course assignment and as an opportunity to apply and strengthen my programming skills..

## Project Objectives

- Apply fundamental numerical methods in a controlled, educational context.
- Compare the accuracy and behavior of different interpolation, approximation integration and differentiation techniques.
- Analyze and visualize function behavior and statistical properties based on provided input data.
- Gain experience in writing scientific code from scratch without using high-level libraries such as `scipy` or `sympy`.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- Built-in `math` library

>Note: All numerical methods are implemented manually in accordance with the project requirements — *external scientific libraries were restricted*.

## Features & Methods

- **Data preprocessing & visualization**
  - Visual representation of function values F(x, y) across different y-layers.
  - Statistical analysis: mean, median, standard deviation.

- **Interpolation**
  - Lagrange polynomial interpolation.
  - Cubic spline interpolation.
  - Comparison of interpolation accuracy (MAE, MSE, Max error).

- **Function approximation**
  - Linear and quadratic least squares fitting.
  - Accuracy analysis using RMSE and R².
  - Visual overlay of approximation vs original data.

- **Numerical integration**
  - Trapezoidal method.
  - Simpson’s rule.
  - Convergence comparison across different methods and resolutions.

- **Numerical differentiation**
  - Partial derivative with respect to x using finite differences.
  - Error analysis of derivatives based on sample resolution.
  - Function monotonicity detection.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klaudiawoch/numerical-algorithms.git
cd numerical-algorithms
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and required packages installed:

`pip install numpy matplotlib`

3. Run the script:

`python project.py`

>Make sure that the data_140762.txt file is in the same directory as project.py.

For a detailed description of all methods, visual results, equations, and conclusions, see the full report:

The report includes:

- Graphical output for each method

- Mathematical foundations

- Implementation details

- Methodological insights and performance evaluation

## Author & Motivation
This project was created individually as part of my studies in numerical algorithms. My goal was not only to pass the course, but to deepen my understanding of numerical computation by coding everything from scratch. This is one of my first structured technical projects and serves as a checkpoint for future growth in data science and scientific computing.

## Limitations
 - No automated tests (not required in scope of the course).

- Single-file implementation due to course constraints.

- Only basic libraries allowed – no scipy, sympy, or machine learning tools.

## Sample Visuals
Here are a few selected plots generated by the script:
