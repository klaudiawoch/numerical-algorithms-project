# Numerical Methods Toolkit for Scientific Computation

A modular Python-based implementation of core numerical methods — including interpolation, approximation, integration, and differentiation — applied to a bivariate function F(x,y). The project focuses on **transparent implementation, method comparison, and visual verification**, without relying on high-level scientific libraries.

>Originally developed as part of a university course in numerical algorithms, this project has been extended and structured to serve as a practical toolkit for scientific computing and algorithmic validation.

---

## Key Features

- Manual implementation of core numerical methods

- Visualization of multidimensional function layers

- Performance and error metric comparison across methods

- Clean structure with documented logic and visual output

- No reliance on scipy, sympy, or machine learning libraries

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **NumPy** - numerical array operations
- **Matplotlib** - data visualization
- Built-in `math` library - for low-level computation

>Note: All numerical logic implemented manually. No high-level numerical libraries allowed due to course constraints - reflecting strong algorithmic understanding.

## Sample Input Format

The data.txt file contains tab-separated values in the following format:

```
x          y      	f(x,y)
-10.00000 -10.00000 -293.73141
-9.31034 -10.00000 -184.15177
...
```

- Input is expected to be clean and prevalidated

- Function values assumed to be smooth and continuous

- Missing or malformed entries are not automatically handled

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klaudiawoch/numerical-algorithms.git
cd numerical-algorithms
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and required packages installed:

`pip install numpy matplotlib`

3. Run the script:

`python project.py`

>Make sure that the data.txt file is in the same directory as project.py.

## Author & Motivation
A first-year Computer Science student with foundational programming skills and academic exposure to numerical methods. While still exploring various areas of software development, this project demonstrates the ability to implement and analyze mathematical algorithms from scratch. Motivated to build practical experience and deepen understanding of computational techniques through hands-on projects.

## Limitations
 - No automated tests (not required in scope of the course).

- Single-file implementation due to course constraints.

- Only basic libraries allowed – no scipy, sympy, or machine learning tools.

## Sample Visuals
